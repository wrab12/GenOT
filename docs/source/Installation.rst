Installation
============

To install GenOT, you need to have Python 3.9 or later installed on your system. We recommend using Anaconda for package management and environment management.
For convenience, we suggest using a separate conda environment for running GenOT. Please ensure Anaconda3 is installed.

Create conda environment and install GenOT package.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository (make sure you have git installed)
   git clone https://github.com/wrab12/GenOT
   cd GenOT

   # Create an environment called GenOT
   conda create -n GenOT python=3.9

   # Activate your environment
   conda activate GenOT

   # Install package dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
